# SlimNode

This Docker recipe builds an extraordinarily stripped down version
of NodeJS running on top of the latest Alpine Linux container. Each
Docker image is designed and slimmed down to be 100 MB or less. This
is great for people who don't wish to wait multiple minutes for
their container to create or for people who want to try and avoid
application bloat.

(Truly though, if you didn't want code bloat then you wouldn't use
NodeJS would you? :) )
